Consistent with recent studies, we find that systemic credit and counterparty risks, market liquidity, and volatility are spread determinants. However, the impact and relevance of these determinants change, depending on the stages of the interbank market crisis. We show that commercial bank leverage and the state of the economy are additional spread drivers. We also discover that the key USD spread is strongly related to banks' risk tolerance levels, capital concerns, and secondary market liquidity during the crisis, even after controlling for other factors.}

Using this principle, a theoretical valuation formula for options is derived. Since almost all corporate liabilities can be viewed as combinations of options, the formula and the analysis that led to it are also applicable to corporate liabilities such as common stock, corporate bonds, and warrants. In particular, the formula can be used to derive the discount that should be applied to a corporate bond because of the possibility of default.},

	abstract = {This research focuses on modeling for how corporate bond yield spreads are affected by explanatory variables such as equity volatility, interest rate volatility, r, slope, rating, liquidity, coupon rate, and maturity. The existing literature assumes normality and linearity in the analysis, which is not the case in our sample. Thus, through a powerful and flexible copula approach, we study the dependence at the mean of the joint distribution by using the Gaussian copula marginal regression method and the dependence structure at the tails by using various copula functions. To our knowledge, this is the first application of the copula marginal regression model to bond market data. In addition, we employ several copula functions to test for the tail dependence between yield spreads and other explanatory variables. We find stronger tail dependence in the joint upper tail for the relation between equity volatility and yield spreads, among others. This result indicates the positive effect of equity volatility on yield spreads in the upper tail is greater than that in the low tail. This finding should be useful to practitioners, such as investors. By relying on better-fitting, more meaningful statistical models, this paper contributes to the extant literature on how corporate bond yield spreads are determined.}

	abstract = {ABSTRACT In this article we compare three models of the stochastic behavior of commodity prices that take into account mean reversion, in terms of their ability to price existing futures contracts, and their implication with respect to the valuation of other financial and real assets. The first model is a simple one-factor model in which the logarithm of the spot price of the commodity is assumed to follow a mean reverting process. The second model takes into account a second stochastic factor, the convenience yield of the commodity, which is assumed to follow a mean reverting process. Finally, the third model also includes stochastic interest rates. The Kalman filter methodology is used to estimate the parameters of the three models for two commercial commodities, copper and oil, and one precious metal, gold. The analysis reveals strong mean reversion in the commercial commodity prices. Using the estimated parameters, we analyze the implications of the models for the term structure of futures prices and volatilities beyond the observed contracts, and for hedging contracts for future delivery. Finally, we analyze the implications of the models for capital budgeting decisions.},
