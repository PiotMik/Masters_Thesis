	abstract={Systemic risk, in a complex system with several interrelated variables, such as a financial market, is quantifiable from the multivariate probability distribution describing the reciprocal influence between the system’s variables. The effect of stress on the system is reflected by the change in such a multivariate probability distribution, conditioned to some of the variables being at a given stress’ amplitude. Therefore, the knowledge of the conditional probability distribution function can provide a full quantification of risk and stress propagation in the system. However, multivariate probabilities are hard to estimate from observations. In this paper, I investigate the vast family of multivariate elliptical distributions, discussing their estimation from data and proposing novel measures for stress impact and systemic risk in systems with many interrelated variables. Specific examples are described for the multivariate Student-t and the multivariate normal distributions applied to financial stress testing. An example of the US equity market illustrates the practical potentials of this approach.},

The author explains why a copula function approach should be used to specify the joint distribution of survival times after marginal distributions of survival times are derived from market information, such as risky bond prices or asset swap spreads. He shows that the current approach to default correlation through asset correlation is equivalent to using a normal copula function.

The conditional copula mass function for the integer tick-size price changes has time-varying parameters that are driven by the score of the predictive likelihood function. The marginal distributions are Skellam and also have score-driven time-varying parameters. We show that the integration steps in the copula mass function for large dimensions can be accurately approximated via numerical integration. The resulting computational gains lead to a methodology that can treat high-dimensional applications. Its accuracy is shown by an extensive simulation study. In our empirical application of 10 US bank stocks, we reveal strong evidence of time-varying intraday dependence patterns: Dependence starts at a low level but generally rises during the day. Based on one-step-ahead out-of-sample density forecasting, we find that our new model outperforms benchmarks for intraday dependence such as the cubic spline model, the fixed correlation model, or the rolling average realized correlation.},

Our methodology consists of fitting copulas to simultaneous exceedances of high thresholds, and computing copula-based measures of interdependence and contagion. Using 21 pairs of emerging stock markets daily returns, we investigate if dependence increases with crisis, and analyse the chances of both markets crashing together. Dependence at joint positive and negative extreme returns levels may differ. This type of asymmetry is captured by the upper and lower tail dependence coefficients. Propagation of crisis may be faster in one direction, and this feature is captured by asymmetric copulas. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The dependence between individuals in a group is modelled by a group specific quantity, which can be interpreted as an unobserved covariate common to the individuals in the group and assumed to follow a positive stable distribution. It is possible to include covariates in the model and discuss whether the dependence is still present after specific covariates are taken into account. If the conditional hazards are proportional, then the hazards in the marginal distributions are also proportional, but with different constants of proportionality. Also the hazard for the minimum in a group is proportional to the marginal hazards. If the conditional distributions given the group quantity are Weibull then the marginal distributions are also Weibull. This class can be used to test the hypothesis of independence of litter mates in the proportional hazards model.},

	ABSTRACT = {Improving the efficiency of renewable energy and electricity utilization is an urgent problem for China under the objectives of carbon peaking and carbon neutralization. This paper proposes an optimization scheduling method of electric vehicles (EV) combined with wind and photovoltaic power based on the Frank-Copula-GlueCVaR. First, a joint output model based on copula theory was built to describe the correlation between wind and photovoltaic power output. Second, the Frank-Copula-GlueCVaR index was introduced in a novel way. Operators can now predetermine the future wind-photovoltaic joint output range based on this index and according to their risk preferences. Third, an optimal scheduling model aimed at reducing the group charging cost of EVs was proposed, thereby encouraging EV owners to participate in the demand response. Fourth, this paper: proposes the application of a Variant Roth–Serve algorithm; regards the EV group as a multi-intelligent group; and finds the Pareto optimal strategy of the EV group through continuous learning. Finally, case study results are shown to effectively absorb more renewable energy, reduce the consumption cost of the EV group, and suppress the load fluctuation of the whole EV group, which has a practical significance and theoretical value.},

The existing literature assumes normality and linearity in the analysis, which is not the case in our sample. Thus, through a powerful and flexible copula approach, we study the dependence at the mean of the joint distribution by using the Gaussian copula marginal regression method and the dependence structure at the tails by using various copula functions. To our knowledge, this is the first application of the copula marginal regression model to bond market data. In addition, we employ several copula functions to test for the tail dependence between yield spreads and other explanatory variables. We find stronger tail dependence in the joint upper tail for the relation between equity volatility and yield spreads, among others. This result indicates the positive effect of equity volatility on yield spreads in the upper tail is greater than that in the low tail. This finding should be useful to practitioners, such as investors. By relying on better-fitting, more meaningful statistical models, this paper contributes to the extant literature on how corporate bond yield spreads are determined.}

The first model is a simple one-factor model in which the logarithm of the spot price of the commodity is assumed to follow a mean reverting process. The second model takes into account a second stochastic factor, the convenience yield of the commodity, which is assumed to follow a mean reverting process. Finally, the third model also includes stochastic interest rates. The Kalman filter methodology is used to estimate the parameters of the three models for two commercial commodities, copper and oil, and one precious metal, gold. The analysis reveals strong mean reversion in the commercial commodity prices. Using the estimated parameters, we analyze the implications of the models for the term structure of futures prices and volatilities beyond the observed contracts, and for hedging contracts for future delivery. Finally, we analyze the implications of the models for capital budgeting decisions.},

The advantage of the vine copula approach is that it allows us to capture important characteristics of petroleum price changes, including skewness and fat-tailedness in the marginal distributions of individual price change series as well as heterogeneous (tail) dependence patterns between different pairs of price changes. The out-of-sample hedging effectiveness of two popular classes of vine copula models – canonical (C-) and drawable (D-) vine copula models – are evaluated and compared with that of the widely used nonparametric method and three standard multivariate copula models. The empirical results reveal that the D-vine copula model is a good and safe choice in managing the downside risk of the refinery.}

	abstract = {Interest in the impact of agriculture on soil structure or changing soil species makeup has increased. Due to its major position as one of the more important crops, more research into soybean (Glycine max L. (Merr)) management can contribute to better understanding of its production. With respect to the importance of soybean production worldwide, its production must be evaluated from different perspectives including its symbiosis with soil microbes. Soybean is an important source of food, protein, and oil, and hence more research is essential to increase its yield under different conditions, including stress. The most important countries of the world with the highest rate of soybean production include the USA, Brazil, Argentina, China, and India. Many crop species including soybean are found associated with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and rhizobia. However, other beneficial rhizospheric microorganisms have also been tested, applied, and used as biofertilizers. Microbial interactions may have important functions in soybean production and health. It is also important to evaluate the abiotic factors which interact with the growth and yield of this crop. This chapter explores the current available information relevant to the benefits of soybean production worldwide. Among the major factors affecting the production of soybean is the appropriate use of inocula. Better knowledge of the wide variation in abiotic/biotic parameters is important for understanding the ecology of the soybean system and for management purposes. Evaluation of soybean production, worldwide, can improve our understanding relative to the effects of different factors affecting the growth and yield of soybean globally.}

	abstract = {Regular vine distributions which constitute a flexible class of multivariate dependence models are discussed. Since multivariate copulae constructed through pair-copula decompositions were introduced to the statistical community, interest in these models has been growing steadily and they are finding successful applications in various fields. Research so far has however been concentrating on so-called canonical and D-vine copulae, which are more restrictive cases of regular vine copulae. It is shown how to evaluate the density of arbitrary regular vine specifications. This opens the vine copula methodology to the flexible modeling of complex dependencies even in larger dimensions. In this regard, a new automated model selection and estimation technique based on graph theoretical considerations is presented. This comprehensive search strategy is evaluated in a large simulation study and applied to a 16-dimensional financial data set of international equity, fixed income and commodity indices which were observed over the last decade, in particular during the recent financial crisis. The analysis provides economically well interpretable results and interesting insights into the dependence structure among these indices.}
