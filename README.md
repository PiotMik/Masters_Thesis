The purpose of the thesis is to examine the applications of _Vine Copula_ models with respect to modeling the spread of 3 financial instruments. We provide the theory necessary to define these models, discuss current approaches to spread modeling, and calibrate the Vine Copula model to real data representing _soybean crush spread_. In this model, we numerically price European spread options.
